Rescue Meals is a transformative initiative aimed at addressing the pressing issue of food wastage while extending a helping hand to those in need. This innovative web-based platform serves as a bridge between surplus food providers—such as event organizers, restaurants, and households—and charitable organizations, orphanages, and shelters. Through a streamlined process, users can register leftover food for pickup and redistribution, ensuring it reaches the less fortunate rather than going to waste.
Additionally, Rescue Meals empowers individuals to contribute monetarily, supporting transportation and logistics. With a user-friendly interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and robust backend integration with PHP and MySQL, this platform is designed to deliver efficiency, security, and a meaningful impact. Rescue Meals is not just a solution to food waste—it’s a mission to foster community nourishment and create a sustainable future.
